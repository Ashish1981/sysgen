# Automated MVS3.8 Sysgen

## Changes

* Edited `create.dasd.sh`: removed read to ask for compression. Always compress now.
* Edited `condcode.rexx`: returns non-zero if any jobs have a return code greater than 0004. Can now be used in scripts.
* Edited `smp1.cnf`, `smp2.cnf`, and `sysgen.cnf` to change 3215 console to 3215-C for automation
* Added `SYSGEN` alias to `UCPUB001` for software installs in `jcl/mvs01.jcl`
* Modified `jcl/sysgen05.jcl` changing `,DYNAMNBR=20` to `,DYNAMNBR=64`

## Info

This repo is heavily based on Jay Moseley sysgen. His writeup is a wonderful resource and you should read the site here: http://www.jaymoseley.com/hercules/installMVS/iMVSintroV7.htm

A lot of the information contained on this repo is directly from his sysgen walkthrough.

There are lots of files and folders. Each folder has a readme explaining from a high level what each file does.

## System Generation

To build your own sysgen mvs 3.8j system launch: `sysgen.sh`

## System Setup Information:

From: http://www.jaymoseley.com/hercules/installMVS/iCUSTv7.htm

Much of the operation of MVS is controlled by JES2 and the parameters that affect JES2 are contained in the member JES2PM00 in SYS1.PARMLIB.  The three main functions are job entry (readers), job execution (job classes), and output (printers and punches).

**Card Readers**

There is one Hercules emulated card reader that is controlled by JES2 - the 2540R at address `x'00c'`. There are other card readers generated into the system and one of those is also defined in the Hercules configuration file - the 2540R at address `x'01c'`.

**Printers**

There are two emulated printers controlled by JES2 - the 1403 at address `x'00e'` and the 3211 at address `x'00f'`. The 1403 printer defined at address `x'015'` is a special case as it defined as, and dedicated to the hardcopy log; it is not controlled by JES2. There are other printers generated into the system, but they are not defined in the configuration file; they are simply 'extra' printers.

**Card Punch**

There is one emulated card punch that is controlled by JES2 - the 2540P at address `x'00d'`.  There are other card punches generated into the system and one of those is also definied in the Hercules configuration file - the 2540P at address `x'01d'`.

**CLASS**

The `CLASS=` parameter on the JOB card determines the class that the job is intended to be run in.

There are six initiators defined to JES2, three are not active when MVS is IPLed, but three of them are automatically started.  The initiators select a job for execution when the `CLASS=` parameter on the JOB card matches one of the CLASSES the initiator is set to process.  Currently the initiators are set to process these classes (listed in order by highest priority first):

| Initiator 1 | Initiator 2 | Initiator 3 | Initiator 4 (not started) | Initiator 5 (not started) | Initiator 6 (not started) |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
| A           |     B,A     |      S      |         D,C,B,A           |  E,C,B,A                  |   F,E,C,B,A               |


Class **S** is intended for use for System Programming tasks, so some of the control has been loosened on that class, which is why you don't have to 'approve' embedded console commands.  It is not a good idea to simply use S for all of your jobs, however, as there are good reasons for those controls being in place.

The two printers controlled by JES2 are set to select non-held printer output in class **A** (the 1403 at x'00e') and class M (the 3211 at x'00f').

The card punch controlled by JES2 is set to select non-held punch output in class **B**.

Some of the parameters for JES2 may be changed from the MVS console and the changes will only remain in effect until the next IPL.  Some of the parameters must be changed by altering the JES2PM00 member in SYS1.PARMLIB, then stopping and restarting JES2.
